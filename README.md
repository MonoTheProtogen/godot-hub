A simple project and version manager for the Godot Game Engine made using Electron and Node.js

## Features
- Managing and creating Godot projects
- Managing, installing and removing Godot engine versions
- Home tab with a neat and concise layout that displays the most recent data from the 2 main tabs (projects, versions)
- ability to define custom filepaths for version downloads and project folders

## Development status
This program is very unfinished, currently it has *no* features that actually work, I don't have that much time to work on it, but whenever I find the time (and motiviation) to work on it, I try to add as much as I can, but as of now, this program only does the bare minimum, that being that it has UI, and that's about it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

This app ***does not*** have any prebuilt binaries yet, as soon as it is in a functional state, I will be shipping prebuilt binaries in the releases tab, until then, anyone is welcome to build the app themselves by using the source code, any changes made to the source code must follow the license guidelines.
