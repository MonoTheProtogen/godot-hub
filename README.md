A simple project and version manager for the Godot Game Engine made using Electron and Node.js
## Features
- Managing and creating Godot projects
- Managing, installing and removing Godot engine versions
- Displaying Godot engine news
- Home tab with a neat and concise layout that displays the most recent data from the 3 main tabs (projects, versions, news)
- ability to define custom filepaths for version downloads and project folders

## Development status
This program is very unfinished, currently it has *no* features that actually work, I don't have that much time to work on it, but whenever I find the time (and motiviation) to work on it, I try to add as much as I can, but as of now, this program only does the bare minimum, that being that it has UI, and that's about it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
